<h2>What is 2048 Cupcakes?</h2>

<p>2048 Cupcakes is a variation of the original 2048 game, which was developed by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The goal of the game remains the same: slide tiles on a grid to combine them and reach the highest possible value. However, instead of merging numbered tiles, you combine different types of cupcakes, each represented by a unique and delicious image.</p>

<p>The game starts with two cupcake tiles, and every time you make a move, a new cupcake appears on the grid. The challenge is to combine identical cupcakes to create a higher value cupcake, eventually aiming to achieve the ultimate cupcake with the highest score.</p>
